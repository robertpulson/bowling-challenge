Calculate Scores for Ten Pin Bowling with JavaScript. The aim of this task was to produce a calculator which could record scores for a game of bowling. Taking into account the maths involved when a 'Strike' or 'Spare' is bowled.

I was able to code a complete solution which covered all cases for a game of bowling. I implemented some logic into the controller so only appropriate scores can be input. However this solution still requires some work.

# Future enhancements

* Add styling
* Refactoring of back end logic.
* Add final frame class which handles any instance of a final frame.
